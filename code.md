## Aarhus
*[github](http://github.com/acrognale/aarhus)*

Research management for academic researchers made easy (or atleast
that's the tagline I'm sticking to for now). A work in progress that
will allow for organization of research data using file storage, blog
like entries, wikis, media players, etc.

## Pymusiik
*[github](http://github.com/acrognale/pymusiik)*

A music managing daemon that I need to finish (..start) writing at some
point that will focus on auto detection of new media, auto organization,
tagging, album art, etc.
